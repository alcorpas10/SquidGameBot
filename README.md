# SquidGameBot
This bot simulates in Twitter some parts from the Squid Game series, without making spoilers, just tweeting and replying to mentions. The tweepy library has been used to make it easier to code.

The Twitter API keys and user keys have been replaced by 'X's so the code won't work if you don't have your own keys.
